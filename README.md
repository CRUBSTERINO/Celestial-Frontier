# Celestial Frontier
Celestial Frontier is a game developed as part of a term paper at the Joliot-Curie-Gymansium on “Simulation of the human mind with artificial intelligence in computer games”.
 
In order to have access to all the game mechanics you need to have an API key for ChatGPT, which you will need to enter in the game itself. If you do not have such a key, you can write to me personally and I will try to provide one for testing purposes.
 
 During development, Plastic SCM was used as the version control system. GitHub is used exclusively for publishing the result.
